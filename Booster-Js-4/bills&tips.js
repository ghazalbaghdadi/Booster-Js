John and his family went on a holiday and visited three different restaurants. The bills were: $124, $48, $268
To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator as a function. He likes to tip:
 - 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50
 - 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200
 - 10% if the bill is more than $200
In the end, John would like to have two arrays:

An array containing all three tips (one for each bill).
An array containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).

function calculateTip(bill) {}

let tips;
let totalPaid;
