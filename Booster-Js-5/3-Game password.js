/*
- We have three inputs to enter the password.

- Passwords must be randomly generated.

- We provide 5 hints for the user, which should be as follows:
  1. One Number is correct and well placed.
  2. One Number is correct but wrong placed.
  3. Two numbers are correct but wrong placed.
  4. Nothing is Correct.
  5. One Number is correct but wrong placed.

- If the user guesses correctly the first time, he must get 10 points.

- If the user guesses correctly in the second attempt, he gets 5 points.

- After the user guesses correctly, a new password must be generated for the user to guess.
* The score of each stage is added to the previous stages.

- If the user does not find the password after 60 seconds or after guessing twice, a 'Game Over ðŸ˜¥' message should be displayed.

- After the game is finished, the list of the user's games should be shown along with his points.

- The highest score should be shown in gold color.
* Refer to Game "password.png" photo for more guidance.
